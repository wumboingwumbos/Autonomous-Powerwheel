Spring 2024 TTU Microcontroller Project Lab group 1 Autonomous Power Wheel
-
The Puropse of this project is to convert a normal Power Wheel toy car into an autonomous vehicle that follows the sidewalk around the engineering building.
The capabilities of this vehicle are: left and right turns, normal stop, emergency stop, and a special blue following protocol, which can be repurposed to follow someone around.
-
To acomplish this, we connected the wiring from the Power Wheel to a Raspberry Pi 4, as well as using an H-bridge and a mosfet for integration with the motors.
