Spring 2024 TTU Microcontroller Project Lab group 1 Autonomous Power Wheel
---
The puropse of this project is to convert a normal Power Wheel toy car into an autonomous vehicle that follows the sidewalk around the engineering building. This ropository contains the Raspberry Pi4 code used as the brain of the system.
The capabilities of this vehicle are: left and right turns, normal stop, emergency stop, and a special blue following protocol, which can be repurposed to follow someone around.

To acomplish this, we connected the wiring from the Power Wheel to a Raspberry Pi 4, as well as using an H-bridge and a mosfet for integration with the motors.
